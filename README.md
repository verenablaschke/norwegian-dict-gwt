# A Digital Norwegian/BokmÃ¥lâ†’German Dictionary

A term project for the course "Computational Lexicography on the Web" at the University of TÃ¼bingen (WiSe 2018/19).

## Introduction

There are few existing digital tools for Norwegian, including dictionaries from Norwegian to German. Those that do exist are designed for a very straightforward look-up of lemmas. The dictionary built in the context of this course project however provides additional functionalities:  Looking up words in a text without breaking the reading flow of the user,
- Lemmatization, also of irregularly inflected entries (which, due to umlaut mutations, is not necessarily trivial for a learner of the language),
- Compound splitting,
- Providing sample sentences to present entries in additional context,
- Pronunciation information.
This online dictionary is intended as a 'passive' dictionary that helps German speakers understand text written in Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l). It is built
using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework.

The [report](/doc/Report.pdf) contains more information on lexicographical considerations, the input data (incl. preprocessing and unification details), the GUI and how user queries are processed.

To get an impression of the UI, here are the input widget and a sample output (for part of the Norwegian Wikipedia entry on dictionaries: https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordbok, CC BY-SA 3.0, last accessed Aug 25th, 2019). More examples can be found in the report.
